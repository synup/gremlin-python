        Apache TinkerPop - Gremlin Python
        =================================
        
        `Apache TinkerPop™ <http://tinkerpop.apache.org>`_
        is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and
        graph analytic systems (OLAP). `Gremlin <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/gremlin.html>`_
        is the graph traversal language of
        TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional, data-flow language that enables users to succinctly express complex
        traversals on (or queries of) their application's property graph.
        
        Gremlin-Python implements Gremlin within the Python language and can be used on any Python virtual machine including
        the popular CPython machine. Python’s syntax has the same constructs as Java including "dot notation" for function
        chaining ``(a.b.c)``, round bracket function arguments ``(a(b,c))```, and support for global namespaces
        ``(a(b()) vs a(__.b()))```. As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work with
        Gremlin-Python. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin-Python that make traversals a bit more succinct.
        
        Gremlin-Python is designed to connect to a "server" that is hosting a TinkerPop-enabled graph system. That "server"
        could be `Gremlin Server <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-server>`_ or a
        `remote Gremlin provider` <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#connecting-rgp>`_ that exposes
        protocols by which Gremlin-Python can connect.
        
        A typical connection to a server running on "localhost" that supports the Gremlin Server protocol using websockets
        from the Python shell looks like this:
        
            >>> from gremlin_python.process.anonymous_traversal import traversal
            >>> from gremlin_python.driver.driver_remote_connection import DriverRemoteConnection
            >>> g = traversal().withRemote(DriverRemoteConnection('ws://localhost:8182/gremlin','g'))
        
        Once "g" has been created using a connection, it is then possible to start writing Gremlin traversals to query the
        remote graph:
        
            >>> g.V().both()[1:3].toList()
            [v[2], v[4]]
            >>> g.V().both()[1].toList()
            [v[2]]
            >>> g.V().both().name.toList()
            [lop, vadas, josh, marko, marko, josh, peter, ripple, lop, marko, josh, lop]
        
        Please see the `reference documentation <http://tinkerpop.apache.org/docs/current/reference/#gremlin-python>`_
        at Apache TinkerPop for more information on usage.
        
        NOTE that versions suffixed with "rc" are considered release candidates (i.e. pre-alpha, alpha, beta, etc.) and
        thus for early testing purposes only.
